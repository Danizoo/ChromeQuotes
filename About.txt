Hey there! My name is Daniel, I'm an architect, engineer & an enthusiast developer. I love creating things, and I'm also pretty fond about quotes! (Who doesn't like some condenssed wisdom right?) I had a blast putting this together, hope you like it too!

For suggestions, inquiries, or anything else, feel free to contact me at:
